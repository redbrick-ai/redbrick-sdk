    Perform programmatic labeling and review tasks.

    The Labeling class allows you to programmatically submit tasks.
    This can be useful for times when you want to make bulk actions
    e.g accepting several tasks, or make automated actions like using automated
    methods for review.

    .. admonition:: Information

      The Labeling module provides several methods to query tasks and assign tasks to
      different users. Refer to this section for guidance on when to use each method:

      - :obj:`assign_tasks`.
        Use this method when you already have
        the ``task_ids`` you want to assign to a particular user. If you don't have the
        ``task_ids``, you can query the tasks using :obj:`~redbrick.common.export.Export.list_tasks`.

        Parameters
        --------------
        stage_name: str
            The stage to which you want to submit the tasks. This must be the
            same stage as which you called get_tasks on.

        tasks: List[:obj:`~redbrick.types.task.OutputTask`]
            Tasks with new labels or review result.

        finalize: bool = True
            Finalize the task. If you want to save the task without submitting, set this to False.

        existing_labels: bool = False
            If True, the tasks will be submitted with their existing labels.
            Applies only to Label stage.

        rt_struct: bool = False
            Upload segmentations from DICOM RT-Struct files.

        mhd: bool = False
            Upload segmentations from MHD files.

        review_result: Optional[bool] = None
            Accepts or rejects the task based on the boolean value.
            Applies only to Review stage.

        label_storage_id: Optional[str] = None
            Optional label storage id to reference external nifti segmentations.
            Defaults to project settings' annotation storage_id if not specified.

        label_validate: bool = False
            Validate label nifti instances and segment map.

        prune_segmentations: bool = False
            Prune segmentations that are not part of the series.

        concurrency: int = 50

        Returns
        ---------------
        List[:obj:`~redbrick.types.task.OutputTask`]
            A list of tasks that failed.
