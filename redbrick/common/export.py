        -----------
        concurrency: int = 10

        only_ground_truth: bool = False
            If set to True, will only return data that has
            been completed in your workflow. If False, will
            export latest state.

        stage_name: Optional[str] = None
            If set, will only export tasks that are currently
            in the given stage.

        task_id: Optional[str] = None
            If the unique task_id is mentioned, only a single
            datapoint will be exported.

        from_timestamp: Optional[float] = None
            If the timestamp is mentioned, will only export tasks
            that were labeled/updated since the given timestamp.
            Format - output from datetime.timestamp()

        old_format: bool = False
            Whether to export tasks in old format.

        without_masks: bool = False
            Exports only tasks JSON without downloading any segmentation masks.
            Note: This is not recommended for tasks with overlapping labels.

        without_json: bool = False
            Doesn't create the tasks JSON file.

        semantic_mask: bool = False
            Whether to export all segmentations as semantic_mask.
            This will create one instance per class.
            If this is set to True and a task has multiple instances per class,
            then attributes belonging to each instance will not be exported.

        binary_mask: Optional[bool] = None
            Whether to export all segmentations as binary masks.
            This will create one segmentation file per instance.
            If this is set to None and a task has overlapping labels,
            then binary_mask option will be True for that particular task.

        no_consensus: Optional[bool] = None
            Whether to export tasks without consensus info.
            If None, will default to export with consensus info,
            if it is enabled for the given project.
            (Applicable only for new format export)

        with_files: bool = False
            Export with files (e.g. images/video frames)

        dicom_to_nifti: bool = False
            Convert DICOM images to NIfTI. Applicable when `with_files` is True.

        png: bool = False
            Export labels as PNG masks.

        rt_struct: bool = False
            Export labels as DICOM RT-Struct. (Only for DICOM images)

        mhd: bool = False
            Export segmentation masks in MHD format.

        destination: Optional[str] = None
            Destination directory (Default: current directory)

        Returns
        -----------
        Iterator[:obj:`~redbrick.types.task.OutputTask`]
            Datapoint and labels in RedBrick AI format. See
            https://sdk.redbrickai.com/formats/index.html#export
